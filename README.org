#+TITLE: My scripts
#+STARTUP: overview

Here is a small collection of shell scripts which I have written to automate some common tasks. They should all be POSIX-compliant and therefore usable with a faster shell such as =dash=.

| Script                   | Description           | Arguments        | Dependencies                        |
|--------------------------+-----------------------+------------------+-------------------------------------|
| adjust                   | Brightness and volume | See bullet point | =bc brightnessctl aur/notify-send-py= |
| colourscheme             | Set a colourscheme    | =<colourscheme>=   | =playerctl=                           |
| get-spotify              | Get current song      |                  |                                     |
| menu-change-colourscheme | Choose a colourscheme | =<menu>=           |                                     |
| menu-edit-config         | Edit a config file    | =<menu> <editor>=  |                                     |
| menu-edit-script         | Edit a script         | =<menu> <editor>=  | =fd=                                  |
| menu-read-pdf            | Read a PDF file       | =<menu> <reader>=  | =ripgrep=                             |

- The supported colourschemes for =colourscheme= and =menu-edit-colourscheme= are currently =dracula=, =nord=, =solarized-dark= and =solarized-light=. The colour scripts change the colours for alacritty and neovim.
- To use rofi to display menus, pass =rofi -dmenu -i -p= as =<menu>=.
- Usage for =adjust= :: =adjust brightness <+n%/-n%>=, =adjust volume <+n%/-n%>=, =adjust volume toggle=
